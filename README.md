# MarkdownBlog

MarkdownBlog is a simple yet powerful blog platform where users can create and manage blog posts using Markdown. The platform also supports user comments, tags, and categories, making it easy to organize and engage with content. This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience with Python, databases (PostgreSQL for production and SQLite for testing), and web development.
